# C_Sharp_Live_Project

Introduction-

During my studies at the Tech Academy I had to complete a 2 week Live project for C#. I worked in a team setting, managing a website content, this included creating databases to store the information. Using HTML,CSS and JavaScript files. I worked on multiple stories to bring the website together, we worked as a team each taking on a different task of the website sections.

Below I have added some snippets of the code files used in this project:
